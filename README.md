# cocktails-vue
My very first Vue Project is Cocktail bar. I practised my skills by creating cocktails list, which calls TheCocktailDB. Also, I created a search bar to help to find cocktails by an ingredient or cocktail's name. 

## Project setup
```
- git clone
- cd cocktails-vue
- npm install
- npm run serve
```
## Description

When you open the app it will show you all available cocktails. 

If you click 'view recipe' button, the back of the card will show you the recipe. To get to the front of the card click 'back' button. 

Also you can search cocktails by an ingredient or a name of a cocktail.
